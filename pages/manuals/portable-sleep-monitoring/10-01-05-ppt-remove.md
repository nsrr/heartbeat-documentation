## 10.1.5 Participant's Instructions on How to Remove

The Technician should give the participant the Instruction Summary sheet and a contact phone number if any alert sounds keep repeating and/or if s/he has questions.  After the participant has removed the unit, the nasal cannula and thermistor should be placed in the re-sealable bag isolated from the unit and then into the case with the rest of the unit still attached.
