## 10.4 Data Management at the Reading Center

### 10.4.1 Study Receipt

Upon receipt of studies at the Reading Center the Study data will be checked for accuracy.  The receipt information includes: Subject ID, Study Date, date received via FTP, Embletta unit Number, and Technician ID.  If there is a discrepancy between the data contained on the Sleep study evaluation Form and Sleep Study recorded file or any missing data on the forms  an e-mail will be sent to the Site Coordinator requesting clarification.  The receipt data will be entered in a database and weekly receipt lists will be sent to the to the site coordinator to confirm receipt of all studies.

A copy of the Sleep Study Evaluation form will be sent to the Reading Center regardless of the quality or length of the recording.  If at time of download of the Embletta unit there is no data, the Embletta form must still be sent weekly.  A note should be made on the forms that there was no data on the Embletta at time of download. Short studies or problem studies that do not meet the criteria to be "passed" for scoring at preliminary review, should still be sent to RC with any notes as to what troubleshooting was done, and if the reason for the short study can be determine.  The Reading Center tracks all problems relating to lost sleep studies and must receive this paperwork on a regular basis.  The problem studies are monitored and if any pattern is observed study wide we will work to resolve the problem. These forms can be placed on the FTP server or can be faxed to the Reading Center.
