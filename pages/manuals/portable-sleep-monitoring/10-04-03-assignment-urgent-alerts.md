## 10.4.3 Assignment of Studies - Urgent Alerts

Studies identified as potential urgent alerts will be triaged for immediate scoring (within 48 hours of assignment to the scorer).  Once fully scored and determined to meet criteria for Urgent Alerts, a physician investigator will be asked to review the study.  If the urgent alert is ascertained, it will be logged into a Urgent Alert Log and the site will receive the full report and quality grades (QS form) within a week after final scoring is completed.   All other studies will be scored based on date received at the Reading Center via the FTP site.

Urgent Alert criteria include: RDI > 50; O2sat <85% for >10% of TST; Unusual HR/ECG  (A-fib/flutter not previously diagnosed; A-fib/flutter previously diagnosed but HR >120 bpm or <50 bpm for 2 min; HR >=150 bpm or <=30 bpm (no A-fib/flutter); Acute ST segment (suggests ischemia); 2nd or 3rd degree block; Non-sustained v-tach (3 beats duration at rate >120).
