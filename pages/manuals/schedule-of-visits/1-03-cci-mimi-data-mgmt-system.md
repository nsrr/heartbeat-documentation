## 1.3 CCI MIMI Data Management System

The CCI MIMI data management system provides the following tools to assist sites in keeping track of participant time windows:

Participant Scheduler: When a participant is randomized to the HLSE alone or HLSE-O arm, study staff will be sent an email listing out projected dates for phone contacts and final visit.  Study staff can print this schedule out and put it on front of the participantâ€™s binder for reference.  For participants randomized to the HLSE-P arm, sites need to manually add the date to the scheduler after titration and pressure is set.  The SDCC Reading Center sends an email with this information.  Then a schedule of projected dates also can be printed out and used as a reference with HLSE-P participants.  

Participant Status: This feature provides a snapshot of where each participant is in the flow of the study.
