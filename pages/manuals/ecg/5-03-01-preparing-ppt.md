## 5.3.1 Preparing the Participant

The ECG requires that the participant remove all clothing above the waist. The HeartBEAT ECGs will be taken in a supine or semi-recumbent position (according to participant comfort).  The participant’s safety is imperative. The ECG technician needs to be attentive to special disabilities that may cause serious injuries especially for the elderly (hip fractures, etc.)

* The location for ECG recording must be stable and properly supported (i.e., bed). A reclining chair can be used for the ECG if necessary.

* To assure comparability of data, follow the uniform procedures for electrode placement, skin preparation and quality assurance below:

* Explain why we are doing this, especially if participant appears curious. “We are trying to improve our understanding of the relationship between breathing during sleep and heart disease. ECGs will be transmitted for evaluation to our Coordinating Center in Cleveland for research purposes.”

* The participant, with all clothing removed above the waist, is asked to sit or lie in a supine position on the recording bed with shoulders straight and arms related at the sides. If the participant is female, have her remove her arms from her clothing, but keep a piece of clothing or a sheet draped over her chest.

* Ask the participant to avoid movements that may cause errors in marking the electrode locations, but encourage participant to talk.

**Check the following:**

* Bed must be wide enough to support the elbows
* Participant is comfortable and relaxed
