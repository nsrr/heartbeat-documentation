## 5.2 Recommended ECG Acquisition Procedures

The following information is intended to provide special instructions for the technicians at each of the HeartBEAT Field Sites. These instructions relate to ECG acquisition and transmission. These instructions augment but do not replace the information provided in the MAC® 1200 Operator’s Manual.  Technicians that will be performing the ECG should familiarize themselves with the MAC® 1200 operations manual. The key piece of equipment is the MAC® 1200 ECG machine. Other equipment and supplies are listed. For the HeartBEAT Study, the function of the MAC® 1200 will be to obtain data for transmission to the HeartBEAT DCC. The MAC® 1200 can store up to 40 ECGs before transmission. However, it is _advisable_ to store only up to 10 ECGs before printing ECGs for faxing to the ECG Reading Center.
