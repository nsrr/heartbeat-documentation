1. Stand on the left side of the participant.
2. Locate the sternal angle (where the manubrium joins the sternum) firmly in between the index and middle fingers of your right hand at the mid-sternal
line.
3. Move your fingers along the sternal angle laterally to the right sternal border. This is where the second rib joins the sternum.
4. Locate the second rib firmly in between your two fingers. You now have your index finger in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border.
5. Replace your index finger position by your middle finger
6. Move your index finger to the third intercostal space. Make sure that you feel the third rib in between your two fingers.
7. Replace the position of your index finger by your middle finger.
8. Move your index finger to the fourth intercostal space at the right sternal border. Your index finger is now at the location of V1.
9. Make an X with your pen.
10. Now locate V2 at the level of V1 at the left sternal border.
11. Feel the fourth intercostal space and  firmly mark the V2 location with your pen (See Figure 3).
12. At this point, mark a dot in the midsternal line in between V1 and V2. This mark will serve as a reference level for V1 and V2 and the fourth intercostal space in case you lose the location marks of V1 and V2 during skin preparation.
