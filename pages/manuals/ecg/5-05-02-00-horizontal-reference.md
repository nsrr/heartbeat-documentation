1. Starting from the V2 location, keep the middle finger of your right hand firmly in the fourth
intercostal space.
2. Move it laterally and slightly diagonally downwards in the fourth intercostal
space towards the nipple.
3. Feel the fifth rib with your index finger.
4. Move your middle finger to the fifth intercostal space.
5. Move your finger in the fifth intercostal space laterally to where the
left midclavicular line intersects the fifth intercostal space. (The midclavicular line starts where
you feel a bend in the clavicle. The midclavicular line is a longitude that runs from the bend in
the clavicle downwards in the center of the thorax. See Figure 3.)
6. Now mark the exact transverse (horizontal) level of the point of intersection of the midclavicular line with the fifth
intercostal space at the midsternal line below V1 and V2. It comes close to about one inch below the dot in between V1 and V2. This is your reference level E for the locations of V4, V5 and V6.
