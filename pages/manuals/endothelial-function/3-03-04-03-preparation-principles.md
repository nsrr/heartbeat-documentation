## 3.3.4.3 Preparation Principles

**The following principles should be adhered to:**

* 15 minutes prior to testing ensure that blood pressure was measured on the **control**
arm (the one which will not have a cuff occlusion)
* The occluded arm should preferably be the **non**-dominant arm
* Use the index fingers as first choice
* Use paired fingers (for example, both index fingers or both middle fingers or both ring
fingers) for testing
* The connecting tubing between the probe and foam anchor should not come into
contact with anything.
