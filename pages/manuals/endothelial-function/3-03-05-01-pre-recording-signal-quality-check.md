## 3.3.5.1 Pre-Recording Signal Quality Check

1. Select Standby. (Standby message should be flashing
on the screen.)
2. Adjust gain to visualize the signal.
3. Select one minute time base.
4. Inspect the
signal for 1 to 2 minutes.
5. Tap on the designated occluded probe to determine whether it is
Probe 1 or 2 on the screen.
6. Make sure there are no leaks for one minute.

**Note**:  Sometimes a complete occlusion on certain patients cannot be achieved.  If continued pulsations are observed, then inflate another 50 mm Hg to 250 and if continued pulsations, then to a maximum of 300 m Hg.  Sometimes, when the level of the incomplete occlusion is significant it will be written in the this column- “WARNING-incomplete occlusion”.
