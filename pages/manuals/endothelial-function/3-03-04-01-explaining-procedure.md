    Preparing a subject for testing:

    <ul>

      <li> <b>Explain the procedure to the subject:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>See the sample Script at the end of this procedure manual. The purpose of the study
is to test how reactive the subjectâ€™s blood vessels are. Healthy blood vessels tend to
respond with changes in blood flow when a blood pressure cuff is inflated. We will
make this assessment by measuring changes in the blood flow in the finger tips
using a sensor worn over the finger tip. It will be important to compare the blood flow
in the finger of one hand where a blood pressure cuff was used to temporarily reduce
blood flow and compare that to the finger of a hand where a blood pressure cuff was
not placed on the arm.</li>
     <li>Note that the occlusion is harmless but may be uncomfortable</li>
     <li>Some markings on the skin from the BP cuff are possible but harmless and will
pass with time.</li>
     <li>Strange sensations (such as tingling in your fingers) during and after the occlusion
are common and transient.</li>
     <li>Instruct the subject that throughout the test he/she should <u>refrain from talking</u>, except
in an emergency.</li>
     <li>Ask the participant to relax and not to stretch or move the fingers during testing and
to keep fingers from touching each other and not touching anything.</li>
     <li><u>The test is not over when the occluding cuff is deflated and the subject should not
move until instructed to do so.</u></li>
        </ul>
