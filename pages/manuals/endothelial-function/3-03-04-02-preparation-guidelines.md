## 3.3.4.2 Preparation Guidelines

**The following guidelines should be followed:**

* Before starting the test, ask the subject if he needs to use the restroom.
* Loosen or remove any clothing with tight fitting sleeves and remove any heavy
clothing.
* Ask the subject to lay down on his back in a comfortable position.
* Identify the best finger on each hand for testing-use the index fingers when possible.
Avoid fingers with clear deformities. Use the same finger on each hand. Any finger
can be used other than the thumb.
* Ensure that fingernails on the fingers to be tested are short and trim if they protrude
more than 1/6 inch (4 mm from the tip of the finger).
* Have the participant remove all jewelry, watches, etc. and place in a secure location.
