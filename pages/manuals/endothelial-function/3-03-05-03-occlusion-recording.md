## 3.3.5.3 Occlusion Recording

**Occlusion Recording**

* 1. At 5 minutes, adjust gain of the occluded arm to 20,000 .
* 2. Adjust time base to 00:00:15 (15 secs).
* 3. Inform participant that you will be inflating the BP cuff.
* 4. Rapidly inflate the BP cuff to 60 mm/Hg above the average systolic blood pressure you previously
recorded.
* 5. Start the countdown clock (start/stop) icon in the menu bar.
* 6. Check the signal of the test arm for incomplete occlusion.
  * If occlusion is incomplete, increase pressure by 50mm Hg but
no more than 300 mm Hg.
* 7. Check that the participant is comfortable and ask if pressure is okay.
* 8. Check if there are waveforms in the occluded signal synchronized with the waveforms of the
control arm.

**Occlusion Release**

* 1. Just before deflation time, remind the participant to keep fingers still for
the remainder of the test.
* 2. After exactly 5 minutes, rapidly release.
* 3. Lower gain of occluded arm
to fit the screen.
* 4. Change time base back to 1 minute.

**Post Occlusion**

* 1. Record 5 minutes post occlusion, ensuring there is no movement.
