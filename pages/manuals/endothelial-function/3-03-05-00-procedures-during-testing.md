* 1. Switch on the Hokanson blood pressure machines
* 2. Set inflation level to 250mm/HG
* 3. Press OK on the laptop to record participant information

* 4. Deflate probes by pressing the
deflation button on the top left hand corner of the screen.
* 5. Place the Endo-PAT probe.
 * Insert the Endo-PAT probe into the groove on the arm support.
 * Ask the participant to gently place the index fingers (or other selected fingers) into the deflated
probes.
     * Do not use injured fingers.
     * Any finger can be used except the thumb.
     * If the index finger is very large, may use the little finger.
     * Use parallel fingers. Care should be taken that the top of the finger is aligned with the top of the probe and connector.
     * The finger tip must reach all the way to the end of the probe.

* 6. Inflate the probes.
 * Inflate probes by pressing the black arrow on laptop at top of screen
on left hand side.
 * Go into “standby mode” by pressing the yellow button that will light
up to the right of the black arrow soon after the probes have been inflated.
 * After inflation is completed the finger with the probe attached to it can be removed from the groove.
 * Ask the patient if he feels the tip of the probe.
* 7. Apply the blue anchors.
 * Place the foam anchors on the fingers next to the probes, making a
kink free loop that is not too tight and not too slack.
     * The tubes should lead distally away from
the hand.
 * Push the foam anchor to the root of the finger.
     * Ascertain that the tube-connector on
top of the probe is aligned with the top of the finger.
 * Tape the free end of the tube very gently to
the tip of the finger making S shape to maintain the anchor perpendicular to the finger axis.
     * If participant has short fingers and the anchor is resting on the probe, replace the anchor with one
that has been previously trimmed.
     * Alternatively, the anchor can be placed on an alternate
finger and the finger next to the probe can be separated using a small piece of gauze or other
soft padding.

* 8. Remove fingers from rests and place forearm on arm rests with palms flat and the fingers
suspended over the edge, ensuring that they do not touch the probes.
 * Fingers should be
relaxed and nothing should be touching the fingers or the probes.
