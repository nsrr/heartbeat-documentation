Aliquot racks will be set up to correspond to each blood collection tube rack.  Rack setup is completed prior to the participant’s visit.  All tubes and vials are labeled with sample ID labels (if not previously done) and arranged in the appropriate working order.

<u>Low Sample Volume</u>

If there is insufficient sample to make the full set of aliquots for a tube type, fill as many cryovials as possible and make a note on the Blood Processing Form.

Any partially-filled cryovial (less than the specified volume) should be marked with a <u>dot</u> on the cap and a “P” in the comment field on the Blood Processing Form next to that cryovial number.
