## 4.1 Blood Collection and Processing

### 4.1.1 Background and Rationale

The purpose of the HeartBEAT study is to evaluate alternative approaches for reducing heart disease risk in patients with sleep apnea.  The Laboratory for Clinical Biochemistry Research (LCBR) at the University of Vermont will have responsibilities for developing procedures for special blood collection and handling protocols.  The laboratory will also be responsible for performing assays and reporting results.

The blood samples collected and processed by Clinical Research Unit (CRU) technicians or other dedicated study personnel are the foundation for many of these tests.  The most important step (and potentially the most variable) in these tests is the collection and processing of the blood samples.   If the blood sample itself is not correctly drawn and processed, the laboratory results may not be precise or may not be valid. 

This study involves the collection of 40 mls of blood from participants during a fasting morning venipuncture (after a 12 hour overnight fast) and a spot urine collection, during the research exam visit.
