## 4.3.8 Special Circumstances

* 1. <u>Blood specimens (EDTA, Citrate, SCAT-I) cannot be processed within 30 minutes of collection.</u>

  If centrifugation cannot be performed within 30 minutes of collection, try to process specimens as soon as possible after that time. **<u>Note time of collection and centrifugation</u>** on the Blood Processing Form. Maintain the EDTA, citrate, and SCAT-I tubes on wet ice until centrifugation.

* 2. <u>Serum and plasma cannot be frozen within 10 minutes of aliquoting.</U> 

  Every effort should be made to freeze serum and plasma cryovials and the tubes of packed cells at -70째C or below as soon as possible after aliquoting.  All samples should be frozen in an upright position.  If specimens cannot be placed immediately at -70째C or below, they may be <u>temporarily (< 2 hours)</u> stored at -20째C or placed on dry ice until transfer to -70째C or below.  Dry ice is the preferred solution.
