## 4.4.2 Preparation of Participants for Urine Collection

It is suggested that female participants may prefer to use a Nunâ€™s hat for urine collection. If a female is menstruating do not collect the urine specimen.  If so, follow the instructions provided with this collection kit. Male participants, and female participants if they would prefer to, may urinate directly into a specimen collection container.

Specimen containers for routine random urine collection should be chemically clean, and have a tight fitting lid to prevent leakage during transportation.  (Suggestion for standard sterile specimen container:  Lab Safety Cat# OR-29091).  The urine container used must be clearly labeled with participant ID number.

Rarely, a patient will refuse to provide a urine sample.  Please keep a list of the ID numbers   of any of these participants and identify which test they refused.
