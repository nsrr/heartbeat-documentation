## 4.2 Phlebotomy

### 4.2.1 Phlebotomy and Blood Processing Forms

The purpose of the Phlebotomy and Blood Processing Forms are to facilitate the efficient collection of plasma and serum samples from the participants, with maximum protection for the participant and the technician. In addition, the forms facilitate the monitoring of phlebotomy and other quality assurance parameters and provide information critical to the interpretation of the assay results and maintenance of the sample repository.

The completed forms will be included in the sample shipments to LCBR.  Both the Phlebotomy Form and the Blood Processing Form must be labeled with the participant ID number.  All forms must be completed in ink.
