## 4.2.4.5 Setup of Draw Tube and Aliquot Racks

To facilitate accurate tracking of collected specimens, we recommend that you set up a blood collection tube rack with the set of draw tubes, pre-labeled with the provided participant ID labels. The tubes should be in the rack according to the order in which they are to be drawn, as specified above. An aliquot rack, with pre-labeled cryovials, should be set up to correspond with each participantâ€™s blood collection tube rack.  It may be helpful to have the serum cryovials and tubes per participant in a separate rack since the red serum collection tubes are generally centrifuged at a different time from the other tubes.
