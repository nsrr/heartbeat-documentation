## 11.4 Data Entry Screen

If the user starts by choosing a study ID from the ID List, he/she will be provided a list of Data Forms that are pertinent to the selected ID.  If the user clicks on a form, he/she will begin entering data for that form (for that ID), unless data already exists for that form (for that ID).  The user can enter and edit data on the page and ultimately choose to Save the record when reaching the end of the form.

Upon clicking Save, the user will be redirected to the listing of forms for that ID and a message will be displayed telling the user that the data were saved successfully.  Should there be problems with entry on the form itself, the user will be redirected to a new page, but will be presented with a list of errors that require correction.  Once these problems have been resolved, the user will click Save again and move on to the next entry task.
