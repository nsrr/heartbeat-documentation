## 2.1 Introduction

### 2.1.1 Guidelines for Obtaining Accurate Resting Blood Pressure

Blood pressure (BP) readings of high quality are fundamental to understanding the role
of exposures such as sleep apnea on predisposition to hypertension. Yet many factors,
including influences of the subject, the observer, the equipment, and the circumstances
of the measurement, work against the attainment of this basic objective. Good results
cannot be taken for granted, then, and special attention must be focused on BP
measurement procedures.

### 2.1.2 Equipment Needed

1. Tape Measure (cm)
2. Various size cuffs: thigh, large adult, adult, child, infant
3. Sphygmomanometer (calibrated against a mercury device or other gold standard
measuring instrument within prior 6 months).
4. Stethoscope and Double Headed Stethoscope for BP certification
