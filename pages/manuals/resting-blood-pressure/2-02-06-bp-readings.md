## 2.2.6 Blood Pressure Readings

Next, the observer should proceed to carry out the first BP reading. <u>The systolic value
(1st phase Korotkoff) can be identified as the pressure level where the first of 2 or more
sounds are heard in the appropriate rhythm. The diastolic value (5th phase Korotkoff) can
be identified as the pressure level where the last of these rhythmic sounds is heard.

**NOTE:** <u>A single sound heard in isolation</u> (i.e., _not in rhythmic sequence_) before
the first of the rhythmic sounds (systolic) or following the last of the rhythmic sounds
(diastolic) does not meet these criteria for the systolic or diastolic endpoints. _If the
sounds are heard all the way to 0 mm Hg, record the 4th phase DBP. The measurement
should be recorded as Korotkoff 1/Korotkoff 4/ Korotoff 5 (e.g., 122/60/0) on the X
FORM_

The American Heart Association (1980) defines the K-sounds as follows. (American
Heart Association. _Recommendation for Human Blood Pressure Determination by
Sphygmomanometer._ Dallas, American Heart Association, 1980).

* Phase I: The point marked by the first appearance of faint, clear tapping sounds
that gradually increase in intensity.
* Phase IV: The point marked by the distinct, abrupt muffling of sound so that a soft,
blowing quality is heard.
* Phase V: The point at which the sound disappears.
