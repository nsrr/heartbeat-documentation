## 2.2.1 Arm Measurement

The proper cuff size must be used to avoid under or over-estimating the correct BP.
To determine the proper cuff size, the observer must measure the arm circumference at
the midpoint of the arm. This measurement is taken on the dominant arm that has been
bared from the shoulder. Holding the forearm horizontal, the arm length is measured
from the acromion (or bony extremity of the shoulder girdle) to the olecranon (or tip of
the elbow), with a metric tape, allowing the tape to hang freely. The midpoint is marked
on the dorsal surface. The participant should then relax the arm along the side of the
body. The arm circumference is measured by drawing the tape snugly around the arm at
the level of the midpoint marking. Care must be taken to keep the tape horizontal. Also,
the tape should not indent the skin. The chart of arm circumference measurements and
corresponding cuff sizes is listed in section 2 and should be utilized as a reference. (A
copy of this chart should also be attached to the sphygmomanometer for easy
reference.) If the proper cuff size is wider than the length of the arm, use the next
smaller cuff in order to get the most reliable readings. This chart should be consulted for
each arm measurement. The markings found on most BP cuffs should not be used for
reference, as they may be incorrect. **Record the proper cuff size in the participantâ€™s
source document.**

_After the initial determination of proper cuff size, this arm measurement does not
need to be carried out at each measurement._
