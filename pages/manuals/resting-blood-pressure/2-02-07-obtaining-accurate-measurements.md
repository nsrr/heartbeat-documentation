## 2.2.7 Obtaining Accurate Measurements

Once the cuff and device are connected, as required beforehand for determination of
the peak inflation level, the steps in measurement are as follows:

1. Make sure the participant’s feet and ankles are uncrossed.
2. Wait at least 30 seconds after complete deflation of the cuff following any
preceding inflation.
3. Place the earpieces of the stethoscope, with the tips turned forward, into the ears.
4. Apply the bell of the stethoscope over the brachial artery, just between the elbow
crease and the lower edge of the cuff, but not touching the cuff or tubing. The
brachial artery is usually found at the crease of the arm, slightly toward the body.
5. By closing the thumb valve and the squeezing the bulb, inflate the cuff at a rapid
but smooth continuous rate to the peak inflation level.
6. By opening the thumb valve slightly, and maintaining a constant rate of deflation
at approximately <u>2 mm per second</u>, allow the cuff to deflate, listening throughout
the entire range of deflation, from the peak inflation pressure past the systolic
reading (the pressure where the <u>first</u> regular sound is heard), until 10 mm Hg
<u>below</u> the level of the diastolic reading (that is, 10 mm Hg below level where the
last regular sound is heard).
7. The cuff is then fully deflated by opening the thumb valve, and is disconnected;
the stethoscope earpieces are removed from the ears; and the systolic and
diastolic readings are entered in the spaces provided on the form.
8. The subject’s arm is raised, passively, overhead for 15 seconds. The arm is then
lowered gently.
9. The BP measurements are repeated exactly as before two more times. The
observed SBP and DBP values are recorded on the BP form.
10. Remove the cuff and store the equipment safely after the last reading.

<u>**Ways to emphasize sounds</u>:**

* Rapidly inflate the cuff (standard technique).
* Inflate the cuff while the arm is elevated straight up.
* Open and close the fist several times rapidly after the cuff has been inflated
above the systolic level.
