## 2.2.5 Determining the Peak Inflation Level

It is necessary to determine, for each participant, the pressure level to which the cuff
is to be inflated for accurate measurement of the systolic pressure. (This is because the
cuff pressure at the start of the reading should always exceed the systolic pressure—
otherwise the first of the Korotkoff sounds will be missed.) This starting pressure is
called the “peak inflation pressure” and is determined as follows: The cuff tubing should
be attached to the sphygmomanometer. The cuff should be inflated while the radial
pulse is palpated and the mercury column watched closely. When sufficient pressure
has been applied, the pulse will no longer be felt. When this pulse disappearance has
been detected, the cuff is inflated another 20 mm Hg and then quickly and completely
deflated. The observed pulse obliteration pressure is noted and 20 mm Hg are added.
This sum is the <u>peak inflation level</u>; the cuff is to be inflated to this level for all readings
at this examination.

<u>NOTE</u>: All readings are made to the nearest even digit. Any reading which appears
to fall exactly between markings on the column should be read to the next marking
<u>immediately above</u>, i.e., 2, 4, 6, 8, or 0.
