## 2.2.3 Pulse Measurement

Part of the BP measurement procedure is the measurement of the pulse, as
observed by palpation of the radial artery of the wrist. For simplicity, the left arm is to be
used consistently for measurement of both pulse and BP. This measurement serves two
purposes: (1) to document the resting heart rate at the time of examination: and (2) to
permit detection of gross irregularities of heart rhythm which may affect the interpretation
of the BP readings.

_**The measurement of pulse and BP is performed only after the participant has
been sitting for at least 10 minutes.**_ The elbow and forearm should rest comfortably
on a support. With the palm of the hand turned upward, the radial pulse is palpated and
counted for 30 seconds exactly. (The observer should not use the thumb to palpate the
pulse.) The number of beats in 30 seconds is noted, multiplied by 2, and the product
recorded as the heart rate. Record on the Physical Measurements form.
