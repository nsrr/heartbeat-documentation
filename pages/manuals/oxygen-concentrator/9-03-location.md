## 9.3 Location

For proper operation, your concentrator requires unobstructed ventilation. The ventilation ports are located at the rear base of the device and at the side air inlet filter. The device will be kept at least 6 to l2 inches (15 to 30 cm) away from walls, furniture, and especially curtains that could impede adequate airflow to the device. The concentrator cannot be placed in a small closed space (such as a closet).
