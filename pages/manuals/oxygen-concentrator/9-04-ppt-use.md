## 9.4 Participant Use

Participant will be asked to take home or receive at home the oxygen concentrating device.  The device will be used overnight only, for a period of approximately 3 months.  The following is a detailed version of the instructions to be given to the participant.  See the “take home” version for instruction in appropriate language and detail for participants.

1. Select a location that allows the concentrator to draw in room air without being restricted.  Make sure that the device is at least 6 to 12 inches (15 to l0 cm) away from walls, furniture, and especially curtains that could impede adequate airflow to the device. Do not place the device near any heat source.
2. After reading this entire manual, plug the power cord into an electrical outlet.
3. Do either Step A or Step B below.
  * a. If you are not using a humidifier, connect your nasal cannula to the Oxygen Outlet Port, as shown in the picture below.
