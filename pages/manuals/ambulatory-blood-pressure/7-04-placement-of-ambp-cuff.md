## 7.4 Placement of AMBP Cuff

The cuff should be placed on the participant’s non-dominant arm and in the correct position. The arrow should point to mid point of antecubital fossa (or “inside elbow”). Measure 1” (2 finger breaths) above the crease in the antecubital fossa of the child’s non-dominant arm (suggest marking the participant’s arm – this may be helpful to the participant if the cuff is released during the 24 hour period and has to be replaced). Make sure the cuff is snug enough that it will not slide but not too tight (if no more that 2 finger breaths can slide under the cuff than it is not too tight or too loose). 

### 7.4.1 Participant

The participant will be asked to wear the blood pressure monitor for a period of 24 hours beginning on the day of the baseline visit (after all other testing has been performed and completed) and again at the primary end point visit, Month 3. The purpose of the monitor and its proper use must be clearly explained to the participant. 

### 7.4.2 Talking Points

The coordinator may want to inform the participant that he/she may feel: 

* “When the cuff gets tight, relax your arm and hold it still until the cuff is loose again.”
* “If you feel the cuff squeezing your arm, do not remove – just stand still” 

### 7.4.3 Research Coordinator

The research coordinator will be responsible for programming and calibrating (or initializing) the AMBP, instructing the participant on its proper use, distribution the diary and instruction sheet and recording the equipment on the Device Accountability Log. Also arrangements must be made for return of the equipment and completed diary prior to leaving the facility. A prepaid shipping container may be provided for this purpose if other arrangements (courier service) have not been made.
