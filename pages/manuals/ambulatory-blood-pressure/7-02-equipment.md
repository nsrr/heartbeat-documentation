* <u>Space Lab Monitor Model # 90217</u> (each site will have three available for use)
* Child and adult sized blood pressure cuffs (sent with equipment)
* Space Lab software for transferring AMBP data
* 3 AA batteries per monitor

### 7.2.1 Calibration

<u>Calibration</u> is performed using a manual blood pressure reading and comparing it to the 24 hour BP monitor reading.  The 24 hour BP is to be between -5% and +5% of the manual reading.  If readings are out of this range, the 24 hour BP cuff should be returned to Spacelabs for calibration.

Prior to each use, a staff member will ensure that the monitor has new batteries for each new exam.

### 7.2.2 Subject Device Accountability Log

Monitors must be signed out on the Subject Device Accountability Log [Device] and the participant will be provided with a pre-paid shipping container (unless other arrangements have been made through a courier service) to return the monitor within 2 days (if possible) of the 24 hour reading.
