## 7.5 AMBP Data Quality Control

Consistency of editing of the AMBP records will be addressed by assigning a single trained scorer at the Sleep Reading Center (SRC) who is blinded to treatment arm and participant data the task of editing all AMBP records.

This form, and the edited APB file, will be electronically transmitted to the DCC. Records with values that exceed Urgent Referral levels will be identified, with notification of the site PI. The edited report will provide the following summary BP measurements:

1.	Average systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial BP during wakefulness and sleep;
2.	Nocturnal BP dipping (Systolic, diastolic, and mean BP dipping during sleep derived by calculating the difference between awake and sleep BP, expressed as a percentage of BP during wakefulness)
3.	BP variability during sleep (average SD of sleep systolic, diastolic, and mean BPs).

AMBP data files will be electronically transmitted to the Reading Center (SEE Instructions for ftp data transmissions). Artifacts will be edited and each record will be coded for duration of recording, and number of valid and artifactual readings (BP Quality Form).
