## 8.3 Procedure

Select nights with longer recording time (at least **FOUR** hours) and least amount of leak.

**<u>NOTE</u>:** _The acceptable leak for most nasal masks (intentional leak rate of 20-35 l/min for nasal masks and 20-40 lpm for full-face mask).  Unintentional leak from mouth or mask equals **TOTAL** leak that you measure during the PAP titration **MINUS** the expected intentional leak._  

Exclude nights with excessive leak (i.e, large leak for >30 minutes **<u>OR</u>** mean leak of >60 lpm **<u>OR</u>** visual outliers in terms of leak if more than **TWO** times the otherwise acceptable night).  The Encore Pro software allows you to exclude these nights from your calculation of the 90%.   

Take predicted 90% pressure from acceptable nights

Require at least **TWO** acceptable nights for adequate study to determine the fixed pressure.

Studies that **DO NOT MEET** these basic quality criteria should be repeated in a second 4-7 night autotitration study.
