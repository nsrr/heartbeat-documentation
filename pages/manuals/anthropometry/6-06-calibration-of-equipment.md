## 6.6 Calibration of Equipment

### 6.6.1 Stadiometer

Every week, calibration should be performed and recorded in a calibration log book. It is performed by measuring the height of the standard metal bar.  If the standard bar does not measure its exact length, the supervisor in charge of equipment maintenance for the research equipment should be notified, who will contact Facilities Engineering or other appropriate parties to correct this.

### 6.6.2 Healthometer Digital Scale

The scale is calibrated once a week by using calibrated weights.

### 6.6.3 Tape measures

The length of the measuring tape is checked with the calibrated length rod (usually 150 cm) at least once per month. If the measuring tape is stretched or appears to have rippled edges it should be replaced.
