## 6.2 Personnel

Trained and certified HeartBEAT personnel, certified for performance of these measurements are the only individuals who will perform them. Each site will designate at least two such individuals, who may include:

1. research nurses
2. research assistants

Each measurement will require two observers: a measurer and a recorder. The role of the measurer is to apply the tape, take the measurements, etc. S/he reads the measurements. The recorder will assist in adjusting tapes, verbally repeats the measurement the measurer states, and records it on the Physical Measurement form.
