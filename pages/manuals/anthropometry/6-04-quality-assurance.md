## 6.4 Quality Assurance

There are many possible sources of error in making anthropometric measurements. These include use of uncalibrated equipment, improper positioning of the subject, incorrect or variable placement of recording devices, and transcription errors. To attempt the highest quality readings for HeartBEAT, the following approaches will be used:

* Central training and certification of staff;
* Use of a 2-member team (a “measurer” and a “recorder”)
* Use of duplicate readings;
* Use of  instrument calibration procedures;
* Ongoing observation of technique;
* SDCC monitoring of between and within subject variability, digit preference, etc.
