# About the Study

The Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) is a Phase II randomized controlled trial, 4 center trial that evaluates the effects of supplemental nocturnal oxygen or Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy, compared to optimal medical preventive therapy, over a 3 month intervention period in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or CVD risk factors and moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (Apnea-Hypopnea Index 15 to 50). The study's primary outcome is 24 hour blood pressure profile.
